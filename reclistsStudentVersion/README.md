## Collaboration and Sources
I used my own ideas and code, lots of scratch paper to draw out logic was used. 

## Implementation Details
I implemented the functions asked of me in the project description with no real issues. 

## Testing & Status
It works as expected. 
I tested with my own test cases, and everything that was provided as well. 
I compile the executable with `g++ -std=c++20 *.cpp`, and it runs with a simple `./a.out`.
